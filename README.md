#AJAX Captcha Validation

Contact forms are very common in many websites. And basic contact forms work just fine but to avoid unnecessary spams, implementing captcha validation is important. So, I have built a demo on how to create simple PHP with Captcha validation.

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your Android app and looking to [hire PHP developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-php-developer/)
